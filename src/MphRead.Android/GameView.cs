    /// **That is the whole reason this is not a GLSurfaceView.** Everything the
    /// engine does with GL -- loading a room's textures, baking its geometry,
    /// compiling the shaders, drawing -- has to happen on the thread that holds
    /// the context, so the scene is *built* there, and building it takes
    /// seconds. GLSurfaceView answers a window event by handing the new size to
    /// that thread and then **waiting on the UI thread until it has been all
    /// the way round its loop**: `surfaceChanged`, `onPause` and `onResume` all
    /// do it. So any window event that landed while a room was loading froze
    /// the UI thread for the length of the load, and Android put its own "isn't
    /// responding" dialog over the loading screen -- a white box over a black
    /// one, with nothing to press, which is what starting a match from portrait
    /// did.
    ///
    /// Waiting for the window to hold still before creating the view made that
    /// rarer and could not make it impossible: a phone can resize its own
    /// window at any moment, for the system bars, for insets, for a call. Here
    /// the callbacks write a field and return, and the loop picks it up when it
    /// is next between frames. Nothing on the UI thread ever waits for a load.
    ///
    /// Two things come free from owning the context. It survives the surface
    /// going away and coming back, so a match is not lost to it (GLSurfaceView
    /// only kept it as a favour, through `PreserveEGLContextOnPause`); and
    /// pausing is a flag rather than a handshake.
    ///
    /// The loop is the desktop's, in the same order: pause, update, render.
