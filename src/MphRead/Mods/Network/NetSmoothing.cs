    /// snapshot arrived last.
    ///
    /// <b>The fault.</b> A snapshot is composed sixty times a second and
    /// arrives when the line lets it. On a clean line that is sixty times a
    /// second and nobody notices; on a bad one the gaps are 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 4
    /// frames, and a puppet written straight from each arrival stands still
    /// for three frames and then jumps three frames' worth. That is the
    /// stutter -- <i>ça saccade</i> -- and it is not lost packets or a slow
    /// machine. It is a 60 Hz stream being played back at the rate it arrived
    /// rather than the rate it was made.
    ///
    /// <b>The fix is the standard one and it is a clock, not a filter.</b> The
    /// positions are buffered and read back on a clock of this client's own
    /// that ticks once per simulation frame, held a few frames behind the
    /// newest snapshot so there is always something on both sides of the read
    /// point to interpolate between. Late packets have somewhere to land; a
    /// lost one is covered by the two either side of it. Nothing is
    /// extrapolated, ever: guessing forward from the last known position puts
    /// a player through a wall and then snaps them back, which is a worse
    /// artefact than the one being removed.
    ///
    /// <b>Why it does not cost hit registration, which is the thing to be
    /// careful of here.</b> Smoothing moves the puppet a shooter is aiming at
    /// away from the position the authority has filed under that frame -- and
    /// the authority's rewind puts everybody back to a frame, so a blend of
    /// three frames is a shot resolved against none of them. The answer is
    /// that the read point is a *number*, so it can be sent: the intent
    /// carries <see cref="IntentPacket.AckFrame"/> and, new in protocol 7,
    /// <see cref="IntentPacket.AckSubFrame"/>, and the authority interpolates
    /// its own history between the same two frames by the same fraction. The
    /// shooter and the authority are then looking at exactly the same world
    /// again -- more exactly than before, since the old integer ack was itself
    /// a rounding of up to a frame.
    ///
    /// That is also why this is not a render-only effect. Drawing a smoothed
    /// puppet while collision ran against an unsmoothed one would put the
    /// hitbox somewhere the player is not, which is the oldest mistake in
    /// netcode. The smoothed position *is* the position -- the model, the
    /// hitbox, the shadow and the shot all use it.
    ///
    /// <b>What it costs.</b> The delay, added to the rewind depth the
