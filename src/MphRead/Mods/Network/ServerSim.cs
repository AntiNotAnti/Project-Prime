    /// The match, simulated by the authoritative server.
    ///
    /// The authority is not a property of being a player. It is the machine
    /// every player's intent is resolved by. Normal online matches run that
    /// authority here, on the server, rather than on whichever client happened
    /// to join first. The server uses the same engine code as the clients, not
    /// a second reimplementation: the engine's simulation needs no GL context:
    ///
    /// <c>Scene.OnSimulationFrame</c> and everything under it -- input, the
    /// entity step, collision, beams, damage -- contains no GL call anywhere,
    /// the split having already put every one of them in
    /// <c>Scene.OnDrawFrame</c>. So the server can run the real engine, and
    /// the "second answer" objection disappears: it is the same answer,
    /// compiled from the same file.
    ///
    /// What this buys, in order of how much it matters:
    ///
    /// - **Nobody is at zero latency.** The authority resolved its own shots
    ///   against its own present and everybody else's against a rewind
    ///   (<see cref="NetUnlagged"/>); it was the one player in the match who
    ///   could not be wrong about where anyone was. Now every player,
    ///   including whoever used to be slot 0, is compensated by exactly their
    ///   own round trip and nobody is compensated by zero.
    /// - **The match stops depending on a player's machine.** No handover when
    ///   the authority leaves, no stand-down when their line blips, no
    ///   half-second of nobody simulating while the server picks a successor.
    /// - **The scoreboard has one author.** Kills, points and the end of the
    ///   match are decided where the clock already lived.
    ///
    /// Server authority by itself does not shorten the network round trip.
    /// Responsiveness for a client's own outgoing hits comes from
    /// <see cref="NetHitPrediction"/>: the client presents its local result
    /// immediately and later reconciles it with the authority. Remote lethal
    /// damage is deliberately held for the authority, while self-damage and
    /// self-death can resolve locally.
    ///
    /// Nor does it make the server authoritative over *movement*:
    /// <see cref="IntentPacket.Position"/> is still where its sender says they
    /// are, exactly as it was when a client held this role. That is a
    /// deliberate non-change -- deriving position from buttons is what the
    /// intent stream was built to stop doing, and undoing it needs client
    /// prediction first. See <c>.claude/multiplayer/NETWORK-SERVERAUTH.md</c>.
