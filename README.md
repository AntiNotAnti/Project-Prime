## Getting Started

### 1. Download Project Prime

Download the latest version from:

**[Project Prime Releases](https://github.com/AntiNotAnti/Project-Prime/releases/latest)**

Choose the package for your platform.

### 2. Launch

#### Windows

Run:

```text
ProjectPrime.exe
```

#### Linux

```bash
./ProjectPrime
```

A normal Linux client launch opens the graphical Project Prime hub, matching Windows and macOS. On a headless Linux session such as SSH, startup falls back to the text launcher. `-launcher` remains available as an explicit launcher flag, while `-menu` opens the legacy console menu.

#### macOS

Download the package matching your Mac:

* `osx-arm64` for Apple Silicon
* `osx-x64` for Intel

Open the bundled **Project Prime** application.

Project Prime stores its macOS application data under:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/Project Prime/
```

See [`tools/macos-README.txt`](tools/macos-README.txt) for installation and troubleshooting information.

#### Android

Install the Project Prime APK from the Releases page.

Android builds include native touch controls and can also be used with supported controllers.

### 3. Add Your Game Files

On first setup, select **Game Files** and provide your own `.nds` cartridge dump of Metroid Prime Hunters.

Project Prime extracts the data it requires locally.

Your original cartridge dump is left untouched.

### 4. Play

Once setup is complete, launch the game from the Project Prime hub.

---

## Controls

Some useful defaults:

| Input         | Action            |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| `Escape`      | Open the menu     |
| `F11`         | Toggle fullscreen |
| `Alt + Enter` | Toggle fullscreen |

Additional controls, mouse sensitivity, controller bindings, HUD options, graphics settings, and player preferences are available under **Settings**.

---

## Online Multiplayer

Project Prime provides its own multiplayer infrastructure and does **not** depend on Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.

From the main hub you can:

* Browse available servers
* Join online matches
* Create or host matches
* Configure match rules
* Organize teams
* Play locally against bots

Players in the same online match should use compatible Project Prime versions.

The built-in update system checks the Project Prime GitHub release channel for newer versions.

---

## Updates

Project Prime releases are published directly through this repository.

Update behavior currently varies slightly by platform:

* **Windows:** update packages can be handled through the application
* **Linux:** update packages can be handled through the application
* **Android:** signed releases support in-place application updates
* **macOS:** Project Prime directs users to the current GitHub release

All official packages use the same Project Prime release version.

---

## Dedicated Servers

Project Prime includes standalone dedicated server builds for:

* Windows x64
* Linux x64
* Linux ARM64

See:

**[`SERVER.md`](SERVER.md)**

A dedicated server runs the match authoritatively and therefore requires access to the extracted game files from your own cartridge dump.

A valid `paths.txt` must point the server to those files.

No Nintendo game data is included in the server packages.

Example Linux server:

```bash
./ProjectPrime -server \
  -port 27888 \
  -players 8 \
  -servername "My Project Prime Server"
```

Example Windows server:

```powershell
ProjectPrimeServer.exe -server -port 27888 -players 8 -servername "My Project Prime Server"
```

Servers register with the Project Prime server directory by default so players can discover them in the server browser.

Private servers can disable directory registration.

---

## Custom Maps

Project Prime uses `.ppmap` files for packaged custom maps.

A `.ppmap` can contain the map project, imported level data, textures, audio, preview data, and other declared map assets required by the package.

Place installed custom maps in the appropriate Project Prime maps directory and they will become available to the game's map system.

### Map Studio

**Project Prime Studio** includes Map Studio for creating and working with custom maps. Desktop packages ship Studio alongside the game. Open it directly or choose Forge in Project Prime; Studio can run independently and remains open during external playtests.

Map Studio supports workflows including:

* Creating new map projects
* Opening existing projects
* Importing supported Quake III content
* Editing map configuration
* Packaging maps as `.ppmap`
* Validating map projects
* Installing locally built maps

More technical information is available in:

[`/.claude/mapgen/MAP-STUDIO.md`](.claude/mapgen/MAP-STUDIO.md)

---

## Replays

Project Prime records replays using the `.ppdemo` format.

**Project Prime Studio** includes Replay Studio for reviewing and editing recorded gameplay, synchronized camera views, cinematic authoring, and detached video export. Project Prime retains its Theatre browser, quick replay playback, rolling clips, and kill cams.

Features include:

* Replay library
* Timeline navigation
* Playback controls
* Search and filtering
* Clip workflows
* Replay annotations
* Camera tools
* Kill cams
* Video export

Replay functionality is built into Project Prime rather than relying on external screen recording for deterministic match playback.

---

## Hunter License

Hunter License provides a persistent multiplayer identity and career view for Project Prime.

Depending on the configured Project Prime services, Hunter License can display information such as:

* Player profile
* Favorite Hunter
* Career statistics
* Match history
* Progression
* Multiplayer records

Authoritative career statistics are submitted by supported dedicated servers rather than trusting statistics reported directly by the game client.

---

## Building Project Prime

Project Prime currently targets the **.NET 10 SDK**.

### Desktop

Example Windows build:

```bash
dotnet publish src/MphRead/MphRead.csproj \
  -c Release \
  -r win-x64 \
  --self-contained true \
  -p:PublishSingleFile=true
```

Supported desktop runtime identifiers include:

```text
win-x64
linux-x64
osx-x64
osx-arm64
```

Build and run Studio independently:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/ProjectPrime.Studio/ProjectPrime.Studio.csproj -c Release
```

Publish Studio for the same runtime and version as the game into a separate output directory. The [Studio packaging instructions](docs/architecture/project-prime-studio.md) describe paired release assembly and verification. Android packages contain the game runtime only.

### Dedicated Server

Example Linux dedicated server build:

```bash
dotnet publish src/MphRead/MphRead.csproj \
  -c Release \
  -r linux-x64 \
  -p:MphReadServer=true \
  --self-contained true \
  -p:PublishSingleFile=true
```

ARM64 Linux servers can be built with:

```text
linux-arm64
```

### Android

Install the .NET Android workload:

```bash
dotnet workload install android
```

Then build:

```bash
dotnet build src/MphRead.Android/MphRead.Android.csproj
```

The release workflow builds the Android package using the same Project Prime version as the desktop releases.

## Advanced Match Rules

Game type controls scoring and objectives. Advanced Match Rules can be combined
with Battle, Survival, Capture, Bounty, Defender, Nodes, Prime Hunter and their
available team variants:

- **Insta-Gib:** Imperialist-only loadout, infinite ammo, 99 displayed UA.
- **Low Tier:** Kanden, Spire, Noxus and Weavel only. Disallowed selections become
  Kanden; Random and bots use the allowed pool. The server enforces this.
- **No Imp:** Imperialist spawns become Volt Driver, Battlehammer, Judicator,
  Magmaul or Shock Coil. A stable room/spawn hash reproduces the layout across
  authority, clients and replay seeks. Drops and Trace affinity cannot grant
  Imperialist. No Imp and Insta-Gib cannot be combined.
- **Shadow Freeze** and **Spawn Protection (3s)** both default **Off**. Explicitly
  saved On values remain enabled.

Online settings come from the server before world construction. Offline rules
are captured in the launch plan shared by desktop and Android. Legacy Insta-Gib
mode data is interpreted as Battle plus the modifier. Protocol **28** introduces
these rules (25–27 were already used by map identity, names and online bots).
Older live clients are refused during the version handshake.
