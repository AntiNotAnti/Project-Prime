# Frame pacing: 60 Hz of game, as many pictures as the screen wants

The simulation runs at exactly 60 Hz. The picture runs at the display's rate.
Nothing else changed, and that separation is the whole feature.

## Why the simulation cannot simply be sped up

Every timer in this engine is counted in frames. The DS ran its logic at 30 Hz;
upstream reached 60 by doubling each interval and halving each increment, by
hand, at every site:

```
_cooldownTimer = (ushort)(_data.CooldownTime * 2);          // JumpPadEntity
_timeSinceJumpPad > 7 * 2                                    // PlayerInput
_viewTiltAngleH += Values.ViewTiltIncrement * sign / 2;      // PlayerInput
_frozenTimer = _timeSinceFrozen > 60 * 2                     // PlayerEntityNetAim
```

`grep -rc "todo: FPS stuff" --include=*.cs src/` counts **806** of them. Running
the simulation at 120 would mean redoing all 806 as `* 4` / `/ 4`, and would
also move things that are not in this repository's gift:

- an intent is sent **per simulation frame**, so the wire rate would change
- `NetConfig.ProtocolVersion` would have to move, orphaning every older client
- a demo is a **count of frames** (`DemoFile`), so old recordings would replay
  at the wrong speed
- the DS behaviour this engine reproduces is defined at its own tick rate

So the simulation is not asked to move. Only the drawing is.

## The split

`Scene.OnUpdateFrame()` used to be one call doing both, and `RenderWindow` ran
it at `UpdateFrequency = 60`. It is now three methods:

| Method | Rate | Contains |
|---|---|---|
| `Scene.OnSimulationFrame()` | exactly 60 Hz | input, `NetSession.Update`, `NetHooks`, `UpdateScene`, sound, the clock, `_frameCount` |
| `Scene.OnDrawFrame()` | the display's rate | GL setup, render-item rebuild, camera, projection, `GetDrawItems` |
| `Scene.OnUpdateFrame()` | — | both, in that order |

`OnUpdateFrame` is kept **because the harness calls it**. `NetCheckClient`,
`MapAudit`, `WeaponDps` and `ThumbnailCapture` each drive one call per frame of
their own loop, so their timing is untouched by any of this: same steps, same
order, same packets on the same frame numbers.

`RenderWindow.OnRenderFrame` is where the two rates meet, on a fixed-step
accumulator in `Mods/Render/FrameTiming.cs`:

```
steps = FrameTiming.Advance(args.Time);   // 0, 1 or 2+ per drawn frame
for (i = 0; i < steps; i++) Scene.OnSimulationFrame();
Scene.OnDrawFrame();
```

### A side effect worth having

The game's speed no longer depends on whether the machine can keep up. Update
and render used to be one call, so a box managing 40 fps played the game in
slow motion. The accumulator pays what it owes: `-frametimingcheck` measures
60.000 Hz of simulation at a 40 Hz draw rate.

## Android

The same split, in `GameView.RenderLoop`. That head owns its own thread and its
own EGL context rather than using `GLSurfaceView`, so it had its own pacing
loop -- a `Thread.Sleep` to a hard `1.0 / 60.0` around one `OnUpdateFrame`,
which is why a 120 Hz phone drew 60.

It now runs the same accumulator: `FrameTiming.Advance` on the measured frame
time, N `OnSimulationFrame`, one `OnDrawFrame`. Two things differ from the
desktop:

- **Input is inside the step loop**, not beside it. `ApplyInput` works out this
  step's rising edges from the touch state, so running it per *picture* would
  turn one tap on FIRE into two presses on a 120 Hz screen.
- **In display mode the loop does not sleep at all.** `eglSwapBuffers` blocks
  until the panel is ready, and sleeping as well is double pacing -- it would
  halve the rate. `MinFrameSeconds` is only a floor so that a driver which does
  *not* block (an emulator, a surface with no vsync) spins at 500 Hz rather
  than as fast as the CPU will go.

`Surface.SetFrameRate` (API 30+, best-effort, guarded and caught) tells
SurfaceFlinger what the surface intends, because a phone that can do 120 often
sits at 60 until something asks. Below API 30 the FPS limit still caps the
loop; it just cannot raise the panel.

**None of the Android side has run on a device.** It builds, and the shared
code under it is the same code the desktop measurements were taken on, but the
emulator available here has no extracted game files and so cannot load a match
-- the gap `.claude/android/ANDROID-PORT.md` already describes. Treat the
Android frame rate as untested rather than working.

## High-refresh interpolation is back, with lifetime resets

The simulation is still exactly 60 Hz. On a display that is actually faster than
that, entity transforms are captured once per completed simulation step and the
draw pass blends between the last two captured transforms using
`FrameTiming.PresentationAlpha`. At 60 Hz presentation stays on the current
simulation state, because interpolation there buys no extra pictures and would
only add latency.

The first version of this feature was removed for a real reason: pooled objects
kept the transform history of their previous lifetime. A beam or beam effect
reused near where the previous one died could therefore be drawn halfway between
two completely unrelated shots. The restored version fixes the lifecycle rather
than hiding the symptom:

- `EntityBase.ModResetDrawState` re-bases presentation history after complete
  initialization.
- player respawns/rejoins re-base both entity and camera history explicitly.
- pooled `BeamProjectileEntity` and `BeamEffectEntity` re-base when a new
  lifetime is spawned, even when the new position is close to the old one.
- teleports and other moves over four units re-base instead of blending.

This is **presentation only**. Collision, networking, replay state and every
gameplay transform continue to use the live 60 Hz entity state.

Network player models are the important exception to generic entity blending:
they are sampled directly from `NetSmoothing`'s playout history at the draw
fraction. The renderer remembers that exact read point, the next local input
restores remote collision to it, and the intent's sub-frame ack names it. That
keeps the existing invariant that the opponent drawn is the opponent shot at
even while a 144 Hz display receives intermediate poses.

### Local first-person presentation

There are two local camera behaviors, and treating them as one was the high-refresh
regression.

**Fixed-crosshair / modern aiming** keeps the current 60 Hz camera orientation and
may late-latch pointer/touch input that arrived after the last simulation step.
Translation is presentation-only above 60 Hz, but it stays strictly between the
previous and current completed camera samples. The earlier forward projection could
overshoot the next real 60 Hz body position and then correct on the following step,
which appeared as Pro-HUD-only micro-jitter while walking, strafing, jumping or
landing. Known-state interpolation removes that correction loop; 60 Hz still renders
the current camera state. Teleports and respawns rebase the history.

The important invariant is enforced explicitly: `TransformCamera` prepares one
`FirstPersonRenderPose` per picture, and the arm cannon consumes that exact pose
later in `PlayerDraw`. The render-time input delta is calculated once. Camera and
viewmodel therefore cannot represent different input timestamps.

The arm cannon's own authored motion is captured once per simulation step in
**camera-local space** and then attached to the prepared camera basis. High-refresh
bob/translation may be interpolated safely. Orientation is deliberately different:
modern fixed-crosshair aiming uses the current gun orientation plus the shared
late-latch so the weapon never re-acquires a one-tick aim delay; legacy aiming
interpolates orientation too because its camera is on that same presentation
timestamp.

**Legacy / moving-reticle aiming** is different. Its camera intentionally eases
toward the raw aim at 60 Hz. The first high-refresh implementation bypassed that
rule on draw-only frames by building the late-latched view directly from
`_gunVec1`. A 120/240/540 Hz display could therefore show raw aim on an extra
picture and snap back to the eased `CameraInfo.Facing` at the next simulation
step. That can look like whole-scene shimmer or ghosting. High-refresh legacy
aiming now uses `CameraInfo.ModGetDrawPose(PresentationAlpha)` instead, so its
camera, viewmodel and ordinary presentation interpolation advance on one
timestamp rather than fighting the simulation's easing.

The reticle has the same simulation/presentation separation. Its authoritative
screen position is sampled only by the 60 Hz HUD update, and that update never
feeds a draw-only late-latched view back into gameplay. Classic/eased aiming
interpolates the previous/current moving reticle at the same `PresentationAlpha`
as its camera. Pro HUD uses a responsive raw-aim camera in both weapon styles:
Static/Quake welds the weapon to that camera, while Dynamic/Metroid retains only
the weapon's eased visual drift. Because the firing ray follows the responsive
camera, both Pro styles keep the crosshair exactly screen-centre.

The first-person gun smoke is emitted directly from the prepared viewmodel
transform. Linked charge and muzzle `EffectEntry` particles use a per-draw
emitter override derived from that same pose. The override is cleared at the
start of every picture and is never read by `ProcessEffects`, so effect
spawning, lifetime, particle simulation and collision remain 60 Hz state while
their camera-attached origin cannot trail a late-latched barrel.

Controller presentation above 60 Hz may poll one newer hardware sample, but
only the aim-stick axes are exposed to drawing. The draw pass never advances button
edges, actions, aim assist, shooting, networking or authoritative aim. It previews
the raw angular difference from the last accepted sample on top of the already-applied
assisted camera turn. `GamepadInput` then makes the following simulation step consume
those exact previewed aim axes even if another hardware poll arrived first, so there is
no double-turn or presentation/gameplay split. Android uses the same snapshot rule for
pad motion alongside its non-destructive touch accumulator.

Remote players remain on `NetSmoothing`'s playout clock. Spectator and replay
cameras remain on captured camera history. Those are separate presentation
domains by design; neither is driven from the local first-person render pose.

`-frametimingcheck` now includes a 540 Hz case and a first-person basis
invariant: after a render-time camera rotation, the arm cannon must keep exactly
the same camera-local transform. That catches the camera/gun timestamp split
without game assets or a high-refresh monitor.

## Timers that live in the draw pass

Two were found by audit and both are handled by counting steps owed rather than
by moving the code:

- **`UpdateFade`** decrements `_fadeDelay` and calls `EndFade`, which ends
  cutscenes and changes rooms. Left as one per drawn frame it would expire two
  and a half times early on a 144 Hz screen. It now consumes
  `_pendingFadeSteps`.
- **`ProcessEffects`** advances particles, and is called from inside
  `GetDrawItems` where its ordering against the entity pass matters. It now
  runs `_pendingEffectSteps` times, in the same place.
- **The pause map's animations** (`GetPauseMapRenderItems`) advance from
  `Scene.FrameTime` in the draw call; the branch hands them the steps actually
  taken.

`grep -rn "\.FrameTime"` over the rest of the tree finds 46 uses and none of
them in a draw-path method.

**Frame advance** (the debug single-step) is forced back to one step per
picture: the request to advance is consumed *after* the frame is drawn
(`AfterRenderFrame`), so a picture drawn with no step behind it would eat it
before the simulation ever saw it.

## Settings

| Where | What |
|---|---|
| Launcher → Settings → Performance | **FPS limit**, a slider directly under Render scale over the stops Display (VSync) / 30 / 60 / 75 / 90 / 100 / 120 / 144 / 165 / 180 / 200 / 240 / Unlimited |
| `settings.json` | `FrameRateCap` (`display`, `unlimited`, or a number) |
| `-fpscap N` / `-fpscap display` / `-fpscap unlimited` | for the paths that never open a launcher |

**Display (VSync) is the default**, and is the only tear-free setting: an
explicit number turns VSync off, because asking for 120 on a 144 Hz screen with
VSync on gets you 72. **Unlimited is genuinely uncapped**: it also requests
nonblocking presentation where the backend exposes it and installs no software
frame deadline. The old Settings UI stored its Unlimited choice as numeric 500;
saved `500` values migrate to `unlimited`, while an explicit CLI
`-fpscap 500` remains a real 500 FPS cap. OpenTK 4.9 no longer separates its
update and render ticks -- `RenderFrequency` is deprecated and the two callbacks
fire together -- so `UpdateFrequency` on the window is the *frame* rate, and 0
means "as fast as it will go".

The on-screen FPS counter reports the **picture**, since `CountFrame` runs in
`Scene.OnRenderFrame`. The simulation rate is not visible to a player at all,
which is why it goes to the debug log.

## How it is tested

Neither half needs a 144 Hz monitor.

**`ProjectPrime -frametimingcheck`** runs the accumulator alone against frame
times chosen rather than measured. The half that can silently be wrong is
arithmetic: a game running at 60.4 Hz loses a second every two and a half
minutes, is invisible in a screenshot, and is fatal to a match clock.

**`ProjectPrime -maptest "ROOM" -players 8 -drawrate N`** draws each simulation
step N times, which is what a 144 Hz screen does to a 60 Hz game. It asserts the
one thing that can silently be wrong: that the simulation's frame counter did
not move during a draw (`draws advancing the game: 0` -- any other number is a
`MAPFAIL`). Everything the MAPTEST line reports must be **identical** to the
`-drawrate 1` run, and that is meant literally: same frame count, same
`spawned 8/8`, same `moved`, same `deaths`, same affliction results, same lit
percentages to a decimal. Drawing the world three or four times as often must
change nothing about what the world did.

**The scoreboard is drawn on every `-maptest` run.** It is opened by *holding* a
button, and the main player's buttons are refilled from the keyboard at the top
of every simulation step, so nothing the tour writes to `Controls.Pause`
survives to be read -- which is why the one screen a player opens by holding a
button was the one screen no check had ever drawn.
`PlayerEntity.ModForceScoreboard` is the way in, and `MapAudit.StepScoreboard`
holds it open over two windows of each run. A run that never drew it is a
`MAPFAIL`, so the coverage cannot quietly go away.

**`ProjectPrime -room "ROOM" -fpscap N -debuglog`** is how the *output* rate is
confirmed to be what it claims. The log's `frametiming` lines carry both rates
and the steps-per-frame histogram, and the histogram is the proof: a frame that
ran **zero** simulation steps is a picture that a 60 Hz loop would never have
produced. Measured here (WSL, Mesa llvmpipe, software rasteriser, `-fpscap 240`):

```
sim 60.14 Hz / draw 81.0 Hz, 1321 steps over 1848 frames, 2 dropped, 0 stalls,
steps per frame [534, 1310, 3, 0, 0, 1], cap 240
```

534 of 1848 frames drew without a step behind them. The simulation held 60.14 Hz
while the picture ran at 81 -- and 81 is this box's software rasteriser, not the
loop: the cap was 240 and dropping the render scale to a quarter only moved it
to 88.

## The rule the split actually rests on

**Nothing in the draw pass may change the game, and nothing the draw pass owns
may be cleared outside it.** The first half is asserted by `-drawrate`. The
second half is the one that bit, and it bit hard enough to be worth stating on
its own.

Visual effects built in `GetDrawInfo()` must not advance mutable game state or
consume global RNG according to render count. Lockjaw trail noise is derived
from its simulation tick and link identity, so repeated draws of one tick have
the same geometry and leave `Rng.Rng1` unchanged.

`-frametimingcheck` checks the deterministic noise without game assets. With
Lockjaw links active, `-maptest "TEST ARENA" -hunter Sylux -drawrate 2` (or 4)
also compares the actual `TrailMulti` vertices across draws of one simulation
step and checks RNG specifically around `BombEntity.GetDrawInfo()`. The report
prints the number of active trail checks; zero means that run did not cover the
effect.

The single-particle table -- `Scene.AddSingleParticle`, filled by
`BeamProjectileEntity.Draw*`, `PlayerScan.DrawScanModels` and `PlayerDraw`'s
death sparks -- is written during the entity draws and read at the end of the
same pass. Its counter was reset in `OnSimulationFrame`, where it had always
lived when a step and a picture were the same call. Once they were not, a
picture with no step behind it -- most of them, at any rate above 60 -- drew the
previous frame's particles again at the positions they had *then*, and went on
adding to a table nothing had emptied until all 200 entries were used and every
new particle was silently dropped. On screen: shot trails doubling and drifting,
and the first Shock Coil of a fight not appearing at all. The reset now sits at
the top of `OnDrawFrame`, next to the render-item clear it belongs with.

When adding anything with per-frame draw state, ask where it is cleared. If the
answer is "in the step", it is wrong.

### The counter both halves have to agree on

The same split broke effects in a way nothing about it looks like a frame-rate
bug, and it is the more instructive of the two.

Effect elements spawn particles on every *other* step -- the DS ran effects at
30 Hz, and upstream's doubling to 60 is a parity check. An element records the
parity it was created with (`entry.Parity`), so that **its first advance is a
spawning one**; a great many elements put their whole burst out on that first
advance, through a function that returns its value once and zero thereafter.
Miss it and the element emits nothing at all, for its whole life.

Both halves used to read `_frameCount`, and upstream incremented it *after*
`GetDrawItems()`. So a spawn during step N and the `ProcessEffects` that
followed it later in the same frame both saw N, and the parity matched. Moving
the increment into `OnSimulationFrame` put it **before** the draw: every
element was created at N and first advanced at N+1, every first advance failed
its own parity check, and the bursts stopped.

What that looks like from a chair: no flash on the tip of a charging Missile,
and no explosion where a rocket hits a wall -- while the *continuous* elements
of the same effects, the smoke and the debris, carry on exactly as before. So
it reads as "some of the effect is missing", and every number the harness
measured was unmoved: the shots still flew, hit, and did damage.

`_effectFrame` is the fix: a counter the effect system owns, bumped once at the
top of each simulation step, read by both the spawn and the advance, and passed
into `ProcessEffects(effectFrame)` so a catch-up frame advances each owed step
under its own number.

Measured on MP3 PROVING GROUND, 8 players, the same deterministic tour:

| | Effect particles spawned |
|---|---|
| Broken (parity off by one step) | **776** |
| Fixed | **1254** |

The 478 are first-advance bursts, and the rate is otherwise identical -- which
is why nothing else moved. `-maptest` now reports `effect particles` and
`MAPFAIL`s on zero.

## Replay frame costs

Replay reconstruction stays on the scene owner and uses the same fixed 60 Hz
simulation. Quiet history advancement and timestamp measurements allocate no
objects. Full checkpoints still occur every 300 ticks, but serialize into one
pooled buffer with typed accessors and reusable graph storage. Disk compression
and durable flushes belong exclusively to bounded replay writer workers. Instant
clips write the frozen checkpoint/facts directly on a worker using the existing
v4 hidden lead-in. No save-time Scene is constructed. The player also supports
a 24-step/about-1-ms preparation budget when reconstruction is needed. No render cap or simulation-rate change is
part of this optimization.

First-person charge/muzzle effects register presentation transforms with
`Scene.SetPresentationEffectTransform`. At the next picture (or ClearEffects),
only those entries are cleared. The capacity-four list is reused; drawing no
longer scans all active effect elements to reset overrides. Simulation transforms
remain unchanged. Player collision/camera queries also reuse per-player cleared
scratch arrays, and collision set equality compares fields without boxing.

`-netdebug` reports replay time, allocation, GC deltas and simulation p50/p95/p99
over the last 3,600 samples. Maxima/operation means and checkpoint/ordinary-frame
means are cumulative and include startup. Frames over 20 ms correlate checkpoint,
replica-step and authority time with the frame modulo 300 (one log/second).
This measures CPU simulation, not GPU completion or displayed frame pacing. See
`docs/architecture/replay-map-performance.md` for measurements and validation gaps.
