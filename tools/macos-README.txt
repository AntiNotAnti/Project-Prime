Project Prime for macOS

Extract the tar.gz and keep "Project Prime.app" and "Project Prime Studio.app"
beside each other. You can move both apps to Applications. Use osx-arm64 for
Apple Silicon, osx-x64 for Intel. Open Studio for map and replay authoring.

Bring your own Metroid Prime Hunters cartridge dump (.nds). No game data is
included or downloaded. Settings, extracted files, saves and logs are stored
in ~/Library/Application Support/Project Prime/.

Command-line launch:
  "./Project Prime.app/Contents/MacOS/ProjectPrime"

Startup diagnostics without a cartridge, display or audio device:
  "./Project Prime.app/Contents/MacOS/ProjectPrime" -smoketest

These builds are ad-hoc signed, not Apple notarized. If macOS blocks a download
you trust, use System Settings > Privacy & Security > Open Anyway. If needed,
remove quarantine from this app only, from the directory containing it:
  xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "Project Prime.app"

To update, download the new archive and replace both apps together. Their
versions and local IPC must match. Your user data stays
in Application Support. Older portable installations can keep their data:
copy their contents (paths.txt, settings, saves and extracted files) into the
user-data folder before launching. Absolute paths in paths.txt must still point
to the extracted files; rerun game-file setup if those files have moved.

F11 or Alt+Enter switches fullscreen; Escape opens the pause menu.
