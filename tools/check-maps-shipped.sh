# registers a room that the game then declines to build -- the player sees the
# 27 cartridge rooms and no sign that anything was meant to be there. That is
# the right behaviour for a level nobody may publish, and a silent regression
# for one we ship on purpose, which is why it is checked rather than assumed.
